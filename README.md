We would like to express our gratitude to our teacher for giving us the opportunity to participate in this project
and put what we have learned in theory into practice. This project took a lot of work and time, but it was well worth it 
for all of us. We learned more about interface technologies to build an application that works with our project. 
We will make sure that all that we have learned is not wasted and we can master it better now.
